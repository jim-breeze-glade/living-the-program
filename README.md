## Main goal
I'm mostly writing this to have an easier way to take daily inventory without having to keep my notebook on me and write everything by hand.
## Future goals
I'd like to gather enough data to track my progress and trends, and also have my clean time tracker, daily meditation, and eventually move to production for the public. I have no idea if this is even done elsewhere, I'm just building to build
